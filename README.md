# [My Poietic Writings](robertoqsx.github.io)
 
My website's HTML and CSS repository is located in this GitHub profile. It is work in progress. Perhaps it will perpetually be work in progress. It focuses on writings that may or may not be poetry. The original language is usually Spanish, from which I afterwards translate. Concerning possible strict definitions of “poetry”, as well as if the texts shown on the website are or are not prose poems, the question is not the priority to be treated there. I will leave such considerations at the reader's discretion, as for me it is more important for the reading to be interesting, or even intriguing, via an oscillation between the recognizable and the mystifying.

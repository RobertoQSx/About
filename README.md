# [My Poietic Writings](robertoqsx.github.io)
 
My website's HTML and CSS repository is located in this GitHub profile. It is work in progress. Perhaps it will perpetually be work in progress. It focuses on writings that may or may not be poetry. The original language is usually Spanish, from which I afterwards translate. Concerning possible strict definitions of “poetry”, as well as if the texts shown on the website are or are not prose poems, the question is not the priority to be treated there. I will leave such considerations at the reader's discretion, as for me it is more important for the reading to be interesting, or even intriguing, via an oscillation between the recognizable and the mystifying.

**0**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What one cannot compute, thereof one must speak.

**1.7**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Poiēsis* is a name I retain to speak of creative mental responses to
the noncomputable, especially as they pertain to intellection *with*
language.

**2.0**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I *qualify* the noetic existence of poetry. I am not *defining* it. I am
not installing an *in/out* gate. I am not even giving a series of traits
that should be *reserved* to the poetic. Specificity is built through the singular assemblage of nonunique features. It does no more
require a fixed number of features (all of them, most of them, ...)
to crystallize. Uniqueness is gauche conceptual framing.
